1. delete item (locally and in the Pinecone), and Edit it. (updating the Pinecone)

3. Notifications (UserNotification) with the To-Do.

4. Widget with easy ask - insert (save new)

5. Check the whole app and replace all throw ... with AppError, check if additional cases are needed in the enum

6. Fail gracefully, all Errors in the API Operations should envoke some View and 'reset' the app for new recording

7. User LogIn , make seperate Pinecone index.

8. How to monitor user's  consumption/ credits
